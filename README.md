 Problem Statement

Managing daily expenses manually is time-consuming and often leads to inaccurate tracking of personal finances. Many individuals find it difficult to categorize their daily spending, calculate monthly expenses, and analyze where their money is being spent. Traditional methods such as handwritten notes or basic spreadsheets do not provide an efficient, user-friendly, or secure way to track expenses regularly.

The Expense Analyser App addresses this problem by providing a structured and secure mobile solution for expense categorization and monthly calculation.
